# bPanel Settings Dashboard

This is a mostly blank plugin that can be decorated by other plugins wishing to
display customizable settings that users can update. It uses the
[decoratePlugin](https://bpanel.org/docs/api-decorate-plugins.html#decorateplugin)
and [widgetCreator](https://bpanel.org/docs/ui-utilities.html#widgetcreator) APIs
in bPanel to enable decoration by other plugins. Read more in the
[bPanel docs](https://bpanel.org/docs/ui-utilities.html#widgetcreator) to learn more
about how this system works.
